        My name is Ervin Szilagyi. I'm a software engineer currently working for RIA Solutions Group as a full-stack/cloud
        developer. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and a master's degree in software engineering, both
        from Sapientia Hungarian University of Transylvania. I'm interested in highly distributed systems, cloud computing
        and computer security.
