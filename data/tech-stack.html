        In my current organization they call me a cloud developer. I enjoy tinkering with cloud technologies, writing
        software for the cloud and building cutting edge architectures. My cloud expertise is mostly related to AWS
        having worked with its offering in several professional projects. I also have experience with Azure being a
        certified Azure developer.

        Not forgetting the roots, first and foremost I consider myself being an ordinary software engineer. I'm
        mostly interested in JVM languages like Java, Kotlin, Groovy. In the past I've done C/C++ professionally using MFC
        and Boost libraries. I'm not a big fan of dynamically typed languages, but I can get along with Javascript and
        Python. In my professional job/free time I've used extensively the following languages/frameworks: Spring/Spring Boot,
        JavaEE, QT(C++ and PyQt), Angular(both AngularJS and Angular2 and latest versions), Android(usage of both Java and Kotlin),
        NodeJS.
